          Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 project sections should take up an equal amount of space on the screen.
          The labels for Project 1,2, and 3 should be left justified, centered, and right justified respectively.
          As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower.
